						<p>So you are either one of my friends or you are bored on the internet. Either way, you found my personal blog!</p>

						<h2>You should get a cake!</h2>
						<p>But seriously, this website is going to be empty for quite some time. I am currently studying engineering, so don't expect me to have a lot of free time. Still, this site will eventually be updated on all things I find interesting.</p>

						<h2>However...</h2>
						<p>I started all of this to learn HTML, JS, and gain confidence in many other languages. Practice makes perfect, right? Things will not work, things may look bad, but I am constantly learning and generally want to have fun doing this! If there are any glaring issues, contact me via the contact page, but for now it will be kept empty because nothing should be broken...</p>
